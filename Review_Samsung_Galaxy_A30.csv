Best mid range smart phone camera -4/5display-4/5performance-4.5/5design-5/5battery-4.5/5 I bought it for my mom she is really happy about this product and she enjoy to play games like candy crush .
Bought this for my mother and she is loving it. Tested Camera and performance. It's good for the price. Display is just mind blowing. Super AMLOED is awesome.
"Let me drill down into the Pros and Cons.Must go points -1. Display2. Wide angle camera3. Samsung one UI4. Battery enhancementCons -1. Earphone quality could have been better2. Charger standards are 10 Amp, though they say Fast ChargeBut I am actually loving the phone. Quite after a long time that samsung finally launched a great art of masterpiece. I am the One Plus guys who love to flaunt their +1 but still would consider the Samsung as something to flaunt too."
"Good mobile for this price.Battery drains just like that. Not even stood for a single day, even I use less apps and not playing any games. Sound is very low while playing music or other sounds in loudspeaker but on Bluetooth headset or earphones Dolby Atmos plays superb role. Camera quality is awesome. They given many options like Pro mode, Panaroma, live shoot which can blur the background while shooting and after the shoot. Attached some pics. Thank you."

SAMSUNG GALAXY A30 is Good Product and After 2week I am Giving this Review after all I will Rate 8 out of 10 nice product it has a Fast charging & Battery Backup is Good And Everything is best Nice Product.  I have taken many Feedback From SAMSUNG GALAXY A30 Users & I have Taken the Mobile With Full Confidence & I will Tq flipkart
"I was using Honor 9 lite earlier, so 1st thing what I struggled with was fingerprint, it is not that much sharp than my previous phone, battery is good and fast charging adds a plus point to it. overall display is good and Also I realized this phone sometimes gets stuck in between. Also performance wise it's okay. I've not played games in it so don't know what will be the performance. Expected a good performance, this experience I've written using this phone after 15 days. Hope it will help y..."
"A30 is the best budget smart phone with good performance and style.. battery backup and performance is very good.. the camera depth is more saturated comparing to m30.. m30 comes with 3 camera setup.. but not good to compare with A 30 with 2 camera setup.. if u want a good camera with more depth,  then you can buy this without any doubt. and also we have a benefit of wide angel camera to."
except for screen touch i liked everything about the phone. being not a heavy user it gives me a full day batrery backup which is quite alright. fast charging feature is awesome. it takes 1hr30 min to full charge. display is out of the world like. camera is nice too. Twist is this that i was never planning to buy a samsung product but i gave it a shot and its totally worthy.
phone is getting  super hot the entire display is heated and back panel also heated. requested for replacement no proper response from flipkart. opt for good models
osm smarphone with a great battery life.... but with less features... it has super fast performance.. I'm happy to buy and invest money.. just go for it u will understand the value of money invested
display very good excellent battery very good overall mobile is best thanks Samsung and manufactured in India mobile
I would give it 5 star for its display. Super crisp. Battery back up is very good. Changing is very fast. Camera picture quality is ok. I would give a 3 star out of 5. I do not play games in mobile. So no idea about that. Screen size is very good. Handling by one hand is pretty comfortable. I do not use fingerprint sensor. So again no idea about that. I would overall give it a 4 star out of 5.
"Absolutely gorgeous phone with a beautiful display, wide angle camera and high performing battery. Since PUBG playing has become a benchmark these days I have to say I play hours of PUBG on this phone, no lagging, no heating. Absolutely smooth gameplay."
very very good smart phone and I love this phone and thanks to flipkart I found this product in good condition
"the phone is really much good and excellent also but after using about more than 10 days I'll come to know the real experience of this phone and want to share with you all.So, we will move step by step1. Camerasee the rear camera is excellent in day and night as well. one of the great of this camera is if you shoot or capture at night you not see any noise in the photo. Seriously I was shocked but you know what it make the photo smooth that's why there is not any noise in that. Although, ..."
A great phone at this price range. Super amoled display is a Treat to watch. Battery backup easily lasts a day. Fast charges from 0 to 100 in just 1.5 hrs.Rear Camera is superb and has got a slow motion video update as well. Fingerprint sensor is fast. Face unlock not so much but does work under dim lighting conditions. OneUi is smooth and easy to use. Overall this phone is worth the price. Go for it!!!
"Display is super bright, camera is very good, beautiful design, value for money and last not the least super fast delivery"
the phone is really amazing hardly there is no words to express how good it is. the night sweats are completely outstanding. by learning some of the applications dress hacks a little bit but power on this is a good pic at this money offered by Samsung. the AMOLED display is good but when it comes to clarity xiaomi offers fonts with 2160 pixel clarity in the same price range. 4K video recording is not supported. Exynox does comes up with Snapdragon processor. really nice game changer from Sams...
"Excellent phone ...i am fully satisfied with this product camera amazing , display quality mind blowing, speakers good, bettery 4000 but very good backup...thanks samsung for giving this outstanding product...."
This will be a perfect gifts to parents or those who doesn't use the phone much as of present generation.The camera offers quite good clarity of pictures and the battery lasts for a long time.
"Best product of this range. It provides the support for 4G, 3G as well as 2G which is not present on some of its competitive mobiles. Also it provides support for SDCare 3.5 mm Jack. so overall it full value for money phone"
my sister using this phone since last two months. she is not a techno friendly yet she  able to operate this phone because of simplicity offered by Samsung.  It was nicely crafted masterpiece by Samsung. the camera battery backup and performance make this phone legend.thank you Flipkart for the quick delivery.
"I purchased Samsung A30, 3 month ago. This is very good mobile excellent camera result.multiple function to give photo different effects. Good battery timing. Interesting thing mobilenot get held even we store multiple apps.It‚Äôs rate is very economical every person easily afford it.Good storage capacity."
"Samsung A30 mobile phone is an overall good smart phone. Sound quality, camera , battery backup, signal reception is nice. Only thing that compelled me to rate 4 üåü üåü üåü üåü  is the touch which is not that responsive. One can go for this smart peice."
"One of the best phones I have ever bought in this price range. Excellent sound quality, camera and elegant look. And the earphone you give simply mindblowing. Excellent value for money."
Liked it good process good looks fast phone light weight
"phone is good but the exchange process is very bad. My exchange mobile was refused even it was perfect condition as per Flipkart norms. I waited for 3 days to get new mobile and still no exchange. I had pay full amt for new mobile. If I purchase from store at least I get some items like Head Phone, Bluetooth etc."
wow this mobile 8s absolutely stunning..also i am very delighted with flipkart services...there return policy is awesome on my first mobile i had trouble with mobile speakers when i complained for return there retun process is very smooth..now i using replaced new mobile and it is working awesome. Samasung love you guyz too my brand loyalty is allways Samsung i have been using samsung products for my whole life and this new mobile is absolutely worth buying full value for money awesome featur...
wide angle camera is so blur...wide angle is just waste.... .it looks liks 0.3 mp camera. ....main camera sensor is good.... battery is good.. fast charging is good... performance is too good... display is awesome.....it is too good for moderate use and normal for extreme use too...one ui is to too good...
In this price range Samsung A30 is awesome phone. Display/ touch is great with good camera and battery back up. If some one wants to go beyond 10k range this is awesome product. I will recommend to go for this for better satisfaction as compared to the phones in the range of 10k.
"good mobile phone!camera is not up to the mark in low light conditions.display is sharp and vivid.touch response is amazing.battery lasts a day easily.processing is good and does not has any lags.overall its a good mobile not the best!if u don't just want samsung only then go for ""mi note7 pro""better specs at lesser price.thank you"
Super phone. Working good and excellent display. Battery back up also good. Worth money.
"I have used last 30 days..My old mobile prime 2 ,but a30 best performance and camera .Battery back up and speed charge 30 minute only take full charge battery.Best in android user.I strongly recommend A30 in my own experience. I have many Samsung handset all r face battery charging time and battery back up time disappointed. A30 Complete solution for low back and First charge."
It has very nice camera along with the 123¬∞ utra wide camera. It is a super good looking smartphone with Infinity U Display!
"awesome mobile a30 no one beat the Samsung , awesome display, beautiful camera,                        and the Flipkart is super fast delivery just 14hrs only"

display was amazing durability  good totally ot was good and fast charger is amazing
This is first day review.The delivery was fast. Took only two todays.The display is amazing. Only minute lags. Barely noticeable.Wide angle camera mode seems good. Latest android version pie available. Smooth movement. Transfer speeds average. Fingerprint is premium with almost zero delay. Quick charge works and is amazing
Good Phone but somewhere I think that It is not so proper at the time of fast working it's seems to be hang like other Samsung smartphones before so I m not satisfied with it
"The look of the phone is very appealing. The phone has been provided with good processor, battery, screen. Expected a little more in camera segment, still much better than Galaxy M20. At software side,  they provide secure folder (absent in M series), AOD, (absent in IPS screen), Samsung Health (which has grown more accurate), Dual App etc. Bloatwares are there but can be switched off. A good buy for those looking for mid segment phone (above 15k)."
overall good except battey performance...
awesmmm fon..camera bht hi acha h iska..thnkuh flipkrt..thnkuhh so mch..
"After one month use I can say that it is a great phone. You can go for it. Battery backup is 20 to 22 hours for me, I am not so game addict though."
"I was an honor's fan. But now, after using samsung mobile... I'll just say that ""Baki sab mobile me chinese software hay""... Whatever phone of Xiaomi, Honor, Vivo, Oppo or any other brands... Samsung really doing great job. üëç #Samsung"

This is my first Samsung experience and I loved it very much .
camera performance is good in day light. Low light photography is very poor. Need to update the camera features.
the best at this price range.
Afraid to buy initially and  with everything.Only crons is difficult to get tempered glass for A30 size in any retails :).Before buying this phone  buy the tempered glass and kept ready.
I bought on today only ..I used four hour it's a very good smooth display camera everything is nice.
it is recommended by my boy friend in this budget that also from samsung quit happy for this purchase  thanks flipkart

seriously i am so disappointed this phone is good but its battery backup is so bad. i dnt even understand how can samsung  claim that this phone has a 4000mh battery backup. yesterday i got this phone and now am thinking abt to return this phone. and flipkart customer service is very pathetic.
